# Atlas: Group Project

In the final two weeks of the Sigma Labs traning, students were assigned to various group projects, one of which was the Atlas project. The Atlas team consisted of five members: David Ingram, Guy Hotchin, Joanna Hawthorne, Michael Baugh and Omid Wakili. 

Our motivation behind the project was to build an enjoyable game, which would challenge the player's knowledge of the countries of the world.

### How does the game work?

In its simplest form, between a user and the computer, the user is presented with a random letter of the alphabet. The user then has to name a country beginning with that letter. The computer, in turn, picks a country beginning with the last letter of the user's response. This repeats, with the user and computer naming countries beginning with the other's ending letter.

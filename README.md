# Atlas: Group Project

In the final two weeks of the Sigma Labs traning, students were assigned to various group projects, one of which was the Atlas project. The Atlas team consisted of five members: David Ingram, Guy Hotchin, Joanna Hawthorne, Michael Baugh and Omid Wakili. 

Our motivation behind the project was to build an enjoyable game, which would challenge the player's knowledge of the countries of the world.

### How does the game work?

In its simplest form, between two players, player 1 is presented with a random letter of the alphabet. PLayer 1 has to name a country beginning with that letter. Player 2, in turn, has to name a country, which begins with the final letter of player 1's response. The two players then continue, in turn, each one naming another country beginning with the other's last letter. Failure to name a country results in loss of a player. 

In our first implementation, the user would be playing against the computer. The user would gain points for every correct country they can name, and they would lose if they fail to do so. The user could play as a guest, or sign up and login. As a logged in user, the player can keep track of their previous scores in a personal scoreboard. There is also a global scoreboard keeping track of the scores of all players on the site.
